Simplified Rules for Craps

   If the player rolls a 7 or 11 on their first roll the player wins.
   The house wins on a 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll.
   
   IF none of those values are rolled, the last roll becomes the "players point".
   on all following rolls, the player wins if they roll the "players point",
   and the house wins on 7.  The player rolls until either one happens 
   and cannot change the amount bet until they win or the house wins.
